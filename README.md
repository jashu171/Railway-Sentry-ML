# Railway Track Object Detection Using YOLO

## Project Description

This project provides a web application for detecting objects and features on **railway tracks** using a custom-trained **YOLO** deep learning model. Users can upload railway images, and YOLO will automatically detect and annotate relevant track objects. The app is built with Flask and uses the Ultralytics YOLO API for processing.
